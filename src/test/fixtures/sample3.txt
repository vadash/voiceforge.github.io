This quiet sobbing was enough to wake up her dorm-mate, Lily.
“Mirian? Are you okay?” she mumbled from the other bed.
Mirian had to choke back a sob, but the feeling was at least dissipating. “Yeah, wow, sorry. I—nightmare or something, I guess,” she lied.
Then, a drop of water hit her, right on the chest, dampening her bed-gown.
“What’s up?” Lily said, eyes actually open now, and only a little groggy. Lily’s blond hair was in its usual morning tangle, but she already had her thick glasses on. She was blind without them—in the literal sense. The small glyphs on the side of the temples linked with the crystal lenses to let her see.
“There’s a hole,” Mirian said. “It’s leaking.”
“Oh, great. Wait, what? We’re on the first floor.” She came over and squinted at it. “How the hell did that happen?” she muttered.
“No idea,” Mirian said, and then let out a loud sigh. “Just what I needed, something else to worry about.”
Lily nodded sympathetically. “Don’t you have an enchantments exam today?”
Mirian put her head in her hands. “Yes.”
